## Introduction

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an open-source, high-level, cross-platform, interpreted, general-purpose programming language used heavily for science and engineering with immense community support for the hundreds of packages (NumPy, SciPy, Jupyter, et al) freely available to users worldwide. In order to run Python, the interpreter must be [downloaded](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and installed on your system.

## Getting Started

Python interpreters are continuously updated, the functionality of your code is interpreter dependent. While most functionality is backward compatible, some commands are deprecated and/or modified to extend its capabilities. Therefore, if you are encountering bugs or unexpected behavior while executing scripts, it is recommended to review the README.md file at the top level of each directory containing source code to verify the interpreter and package dependencies for the environment.
