## Introduction

[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a programming and numerical computation platform used for by scientists and engineers for data analytics, algorithm development, modeling and simulation, rapid prototyping of design concepts and much more. MATLAB is a framework for which various other Mathworks products are built. The primary simulation tool built on top of the MATLAB framework is [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html). Simulink is a model-based design and simulation environment used for prototype design and analysis prior to production. Both MATLAB and Simulink leverage the power of dozens of task-specific (Signal Processing, Satellite Communications, Control Systems, et al) libraries and applications as toolboxes to extend the functionality of the software. MATLAB and Simulink are proprietary Mathworks products available to students at a discounted price (or free for some universities). Use of Mathworks products using a student license is strictly for educational work and research.
