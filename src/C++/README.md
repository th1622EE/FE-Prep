## Introduction

[C++](https://isocpp.org/) is an open-source, high-level, cross-platform, compiled, general-purpose programming language created by a Danish Computer Scientist named Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985 developed as an object-oriented extension of the C programming language. As a statically-typed compiled language, C++ offers many advantages when performance is critical such as in robotics, control systems, autonomous vehicles, et al. While the language may not be as popular as contemporary favorites such as Python and JavaScript, it is not going anywhere anytime soon!
